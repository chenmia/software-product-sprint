        <h2>Deep Space</h2>
        <p> 
            Deep Space is an Android space adventure game. My team and I built Deep Space at Mission Bit San Francisco's Android
            Game Development course, using Android Studio Code and the libGDX game development library.
            The player controls a spaceship that is speeding through space with the
            help of a solar sail. They will swipe left/right/up/down to avoid obstacles such as planets, stars, comets, or
            asteroids. The celestial objects they pass will be labeled with their names. They will collect photons along the
            way to push their solar sail and keep them moving. The game is over when you hit an obstacle. Your final score will be
            how long your journey lasted, which we will record with a timer.
