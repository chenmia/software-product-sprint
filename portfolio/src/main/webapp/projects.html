        <h3>Deep Space</h3>
        <p>Deep Space is an Android space obstacle game. My team and I created this at Mission Bit's Android Game
            Development course, using Android Studio Code and the libGDX game development library. The player controls a
            spaceship that is speeding through space with the help of a solar sail. They will swipe
            left/right/up/down to avoid obstacles such as planets, stars, comets, or asteroids. The celestial objects
            they pass will be labeled with their names, and we may also add in a feature that affects the movement of
            the spaceship based on the obstacleâ€™s gravitational field. They will collect photons along the way to push
            their solar sail and keep them moving. The game is over when you hit an obstacle. Your final score will be
            how long your journey lasted, which we will record with a timer.
