      <h1>Mia Chen</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Mia and I'm a 3rd-year student at Stanford University. 
          I study computer science specializing in digital information and I'm 
          highly interested in databases, data mining, and machine learning. This
          summer, I'm participating in Google's Software Product Sprint focusing on 
          webapp development, as well as interning in Information Technology for the City 
          of Richmond. 
      </p>
      <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy hiking and exploring my hometown of San Francisco. Fun fact: 
          I've walked from San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito 3 times! 
          (Check out the Photos tab for some of my favorite pictures taken along my hikes)
          I also love to cook, try new restaurants, and learn languages. 
          I speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin, and am currently learning French!
